        <h1>Analysis of the Q Guide</h1>
        <h4>By Russell Pekala</h4>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://q.fas.harvard.edu/faq.htm">Harvard Q Guide</a>, and the supplementary
            <a href="https://courses.cs50.net/">CS50 tool</a>, built on top of the Q's data, are the primary non-human resources that
            Harvard students use to plan their academic trajectory and understand their university's academic offerings.
            Despite how useful these tools are, they were designed to help students select courses&mdash;they were not designed
            for the task of actually understanding the academic system at Harvard.
        </p>

        <p>
            To some extent the administration has incentives to keep this data private.  If most of the value of a Harvard
            education lies in its intangibles, measuring tangible aspects of it will only lower its perceived quality.  The
            worst thing that could happen is that statistical comparisions could show that most Harvard classes are fundamentally the same as classes
            at any other university, a truth only really understood by Harvard students themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps this, not a
            <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1973/4/26/cue-will-survey-44-large-courses/">desire to improve surveying techniques</a>,
            is the reason the university took over the administration of course surveying from the Crimson, who
            started the project in 1925.  At the time the university took over this data, students were assured that that
            student editors would have complete control over the publication of the Q Guide.  It was revealed much later that
            actually the administration <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/5/27/guide-cue-professors-course/">
            secretly instructed</a> students on what they were allowed to print.  Since then, the university has completely
            reigned control over the Q Guide. When I reached out to the Office of Institutional Research, they told me that
            it was not their policy to give students raw versions of the data.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we are going to be asked to front a sticker price of $60000 and thousands of hours of time,
            I argue that we should at least know what we're getting out of our Harvard education.  There are two
            fundamental reasons that students choose to go to colleges like Harvard: to learn and to get an impressive
            credential. To the extent to which Harvard seeks to educate, this data is useful in understanding the
            distributions of what students are studying and where Harvard is allocating its resources.
            To the extent that college serves to rank and measure students, this data is valuable in establishing
            the merits and work ethics of students&mdash;especially as grade inflation degrades the signal behind students'
            nominal grades.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Harvard hides information about grade distributions, all that really does is obfiscate merit and benefit
            students, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/09/19/how-harvard-helps-its-richest-and-most-arrogant-students-get-ahead/?utm_term=.a26d270a678e">often wealthy ones,</a>
            who know how to work the system for higher grades.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's equally important from a societal perspective to understand the nature of a Harvard education.
            As an educational nonprofit, Harvard is largely supported by public funds.  Most of these funds come in the form of tax breaks
            and research grants, but other sources of funding like Pell Grants and ??? loans directly fund student tuition.  As
            tuition increases (driven largely by top schools like Harvard) start to take a serious toll on , the public is rightfully
            questioning the effectiveness of colleges at facilitating social mobility.
            Additionally, with Harvard facing the dual allegations of
            (1) discrimination in its admissions process and (2) not doing enough to support low-income students,
            it is absurd that there appears to be negligible effort
            to statistically evaluate hypotheses about how aspiring students will do once at Harvard.  Unfortunately,
            the information within the Q Guide isn't enough to answer any of these questions since there is no demographic
            information associated with student response data.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Harvard Q Guide has been scraped several times in the past, each time driving out certain elements
            of its vast data.  The most comprehensive recent scraping was done by <a href="https://github.com/rogergzou/Q-Guide-Scraper">Roger Zou '17</a>
            in 2016, who used a python
            scraper and published some interesting Excel visualizations in the student-centered education blog <a href="https://mystudentvoices.com/analyzing-the-harvard-q-guide-1ba02948819">My Student Voices</a>.  Other interesting projects have been done by
            <a href="https://github.com/patrickhpan/scrape-q-guide">Patrick Pan '19</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/ryandkerr/q-guide">Ryan Kerr '17</a>, and perhaps others.
            Like other stabs at understanding this dataset, the following  analysis does not claim to be complete.
            There seems to be no limit to the number of interesting patterns in the data, and
            I hope that others will be interested in this project and continue with it where I left off.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data scraping for this project was done using <a href="http://webscraper.io/">Web Scraper</a>, a Chrome Extension.
            I could not get Zou's code to work directly, probably because of the introduction of <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/10/6/two-step-verification-huit/">2-Factor Authentication</a>
            in that came in late 2016.
            A description of how Sara Valente and I scraped this information can be learned about in a medium post
            we wrote here with our code available on github.  Only students with Harvard Key authentication credentials
            will be able to scrape the raw data themselves, though I am happy to pass on the cleaned raw data to any Harvard
            student that emails me with their college address and save you the trouble.

            We'll start with the information that everyone wants to see first: ratings scores.  These ratings include  are generally
            the first things that students reference when comparing schedules.

            Among the metrics above, the question of workload is the most talked about, among both students trying to
            find easy classes to take and alike by students trying to justify the impossibility of their academic load.
            The concept of telling students how much work different classes take is a somewhat controversial idea. In
            fact, the Q Guide used to feature both a measure of workload and of difficulty, before the
            <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/5/20/q-guide-difficulty-dropped/">2014 Faculty Council</a>
            decision to strip away the difficulty metric that enabled students to systematically select classes that were easy A's.
            Students fought hard to keep the workload metric on the Q Guide, arguing that it was crucial to their efforts
            to balance their schedules and maintain a healthy and predictable amount of work.
        </p>
        <p>
            The glaring conclusion from the above visualization is that classes in STEM fields carry on average more work than
            classes in other departments.  Most people are probably aware of this trend, but actually this pattern is
            somewhat deceiving since STEM fields have so much higher workload variance than non-STEM fields.  Courses in
            my field of Mathematics, for example, had a standard deviation of over seven hours per week of work.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a natural question then whether this variance stems from in-class variance or high between-class variance.
            High in-class variance would be a symptom of the same course costing its students vastly different quantities
            of time, perhaps depending on ability.  High between-class variance would be a symptom of a department that
            has courses of vastly different difficulties under the same departmental umbrella.  An intro-stats understanding
            of variance decomposition shows that these two sources of variance combined describe the entire variance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data clearly show that workload variance in STEM fields comes overwhelmingly from between-class
            variance.  This might be explained by the tendency for STEM classes tend to be sequential and ability-segregated in a way that
            courses in other departments are not.  This variance decomposition might also be a reflection of the
            recent creation of easier courses and pathways within STEM fields that didn't exist before.  JUSTIFICATION NEEDED.

            This chart originally seems a bit uninteresting, there isn't the kind of dramatic expansion of
            enrollment in Statistics and Computer Science that might have been expected (though those trends
            are significant and certainly viewable on a larger timescale).  The fact that there is more enrollment
            in the fall semester rather than the spring semester is something that is caused by more people taking time
            off during the second rather than the first semester.

        <h2> What's class like?</h2>
        Experiences that students have in class vary greatly depending on which department they are in.  One of the biggest 
        determinants of what your course experience will look like is how many people are in each of your classes.  The oft-cited 
        median class size is a poor determinant of what classes look like from a students perspective because it assumes that students 
        have an equal likelihood of being in small classes as they do in being in large classes.  In reality, since there are more students 
        in larger classes, it is often far more likely that students end

            Students' experiences in class vary greatly by the departments those classes are in.  This is reflected in
            Q Guide data through the starkly different median class sizes between departments.  General Education classes
            (in departments like Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding, Science of Living Systems, Science of the Physical Universe,
            United States in the World, Societies of the World, ) had by far the largest class sizes, followed by STEM classes.
            The overwhelming values of

            Despite Harvard's supposed attention paid to its General Education program, it's a shame that these classes are often 
            administered in depersonalized ways.

        <h2> Who likes to work the most?  </h2>
        <p>
            A strong pattern emerges when we look at workload versus course rating: In STEM fields, workload correlates
            negatively with course rating.  The highest-rated STEM classes are those that require the least work.  At the other end
            of the spectrum, general education classes are actually rated higher when they have higher workloads.  Other
            areas were rated somewhat in the middle: workload wasn't as great a predictor of overall course rating.
