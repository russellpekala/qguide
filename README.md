# qguide
Information and scripts to facilitate hacking the Harvard Q Guide.  For detailed instructions on how you, too, can scrape the Harvard Q Guide, please see my Medium post about the process.

## Important Notes
* sitemap.json file is currently set to extract data for fall 2011, but can be easily set to any other semester by replacing one or two things.  
* I have not posted the data from the scraping process at this time.  

## Awknowledgements
* [Sara Valente](ssvalente.com) co-authored this work.  She was the brilliant one who thought to use the Web Scraper Chrome extension for this project, as I pitifully tried to get standard python scripts to penetrate two-factor authentication.  
* Thanks to the team behind [Web Scraper](webscraper.io).  Could not have done this without you!
